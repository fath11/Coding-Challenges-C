This is my attempt of [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro) with the C programming language.
I am learning C at the same time so the code in this repo contains comments that I wrote as notes.

# Building

To build a specific project:
```
make DIRECTORY_NAME
```

To build all projects:
```
make all
```

Project builds all go inside a `bin` directory, to clean it run:
```
make clean
```
